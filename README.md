# examples

These are just some small code examples of previous projects I worked on in the last couple of years.
Some of them are just from hobby projects, so forgive me for not documenting everything like I should.

These are by far not my best snipplets but are just here to prove my diversity when it comes to the different programming languages I'm familiar with.

Socket.cpp: implementing sys/socket.h in C++ to send and receive data using sockets.

scripts.js: JavaScript code used to show and generate a booking calendar with available checkin and checkout dates.

xmlHttp.php: PHP code used to calculate available checkin and checkout dates to return to frontend code.
