# examples

These are just some small code examples of previous projects I worked on in the last couple of years.
Some of them are just from hobby projects, so forgive me for not documenting everything like I should.

These are by far not my best snipplets but are just here to prove my diversity when it comes to the different programming languages I', familiar with.
